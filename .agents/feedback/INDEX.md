# Feedback Index

This index tracks all feedback entries from AI agent sessions, helping identify patterns and
documentation gaps.

**How to use this index:**
- Read this at the start of each session to learn from past challenges
- Look for patterns in missing context or recurring blockers
- Check if documented issues are relevant to your current task
- Update this file after creating each new feedback entry
