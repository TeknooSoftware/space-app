Feature: On a space instance, an API is available to manage and run jobs to allowing developper to automate deployments.
  To run a job, Space will clone the project from its cloning url, install all dependencies and do some other configured
  stuff in the `.paas.yaml` file, build OCI images, push them to the private OCI registry of the account, generate new
  Kubernetes manifest and apply them to the cluster

  Scenario: List jobs of an owned project from the API
    Given A Space app instance
    And a kubernetes client
    And a job workspace agent

    And the project has a complete paas file
    And "100" jobs for the project
    And the platform is booted
    When the user sign in with "dupont@teknoo.space" and the password "Test2@Test"
    Then it must redirected to the TOTP code page
