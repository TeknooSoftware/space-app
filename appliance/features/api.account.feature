Feature: On a space instance, an API is available to manage its account settings

  Scenario: Update my account settings via API
    Given A Space app instance
    And A memory document database
    And an account for "My Company" with the account namespace "my-company"
    And an user, called "Dupont" "Jean" with the "dupont@teknoo.space" with the password "Test2@Test"
    And the 2FA authentication enable for last user
    And the platform is booted
    When the user sign in with "dupont@teknoo.space" and the password "Test2@Test"
    Then it must redirected to the TOTP code page
    When the user enter a valid TOTP code
    And get a JWT token for the user
    And the user logs out
    When the API is called to get account's settings
    Then get a JSON reponse
    And the serialized account "My Company"
    When the API is called to update account's settings:
      | field                                   | value          |
      | space_account.account.name              | Great Company  |
      | space_account.accountData.legalName     | Gr Company SAS |
      | space_account.accountData.streetAddress | 123 street     |

      | space_account.accountData.vatNumber     | FR0102030405   |
    And the account name is now "Great Company"
